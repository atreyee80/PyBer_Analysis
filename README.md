# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
We will do analysis on Pybar a python based ride sharing app.The purpose of this project is to do exploratory analysis of there data and to create  various visualization chart with the help of python graphing library Matplotlib.
The primary things to be done is.
## 1.To show the relationship between different types of cities and total number of drivers and riders.
## 2.To show the percentage of total fare by riders and drivers by the type of cities.
  This analysis will help Pyber improve access about there ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods

## Then total rides based on city type is calculated.
## Rural        125
## Suburban     625
## Urban        1625

## Rural        78
## Suburban     490
## Urban        2405

## Rural        4327.93
## Suburban    19356.33
## Urban       39854.38
## Then average fare Per Fare Per Ride
## Rural       34.623440
## Suburban    30.970128
## Urban       24.525772

## Then average fare Per Driver
